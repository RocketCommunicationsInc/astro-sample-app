###Properties
| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ------------|
| `val` | `number` | Should be passed in as a two-way bound property of an object
| `min` | `number` | Optional. Overrides the default value of 0. Can be a positive or negative number. |
| `max` | `number` | Optional. Overrides the default value of 100. Can be a positive or negative number. |
| `step` | `number` | Optional. Can be used to customize each step (e.g., count by 10) or to force an input to accept float values. Note: accepting float values in the input does not make existing code expecting integers understand float values. |
| `axis-labels` | `string` | Optional. A comma delimited string of labels. Note label placement is approximate and should not be used for precise indicators. Layout is based on `flex-box` with `justify-content: space-between` meaning with three labels the first will appear at flush left the second will appear roughly halfway and the last will appear flush right. |
| `label` | `string` | Optional. Label for the slider element |
