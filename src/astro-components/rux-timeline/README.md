#Clock
The RUX Clock component is a custom clock instance relavant to SATCOM/SATOPS operations running a constant 24 hour clock set to UTC along with the day of the year. RUX Clock also supports displaying AOS (Acquisition of Signal), LOS (Loss of Signal) and timezone support.

RUX Clock is based on the industry standard [WebComponents v1 spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html) and implemented with [Polymer Project 3](https://www.polymer-project.org) for backwards compatibility and document binding.

RUX Clock is supplied as-is and â€¦

##Usage
###Import the RUX Clock

###Basic HTML Usage
RUX Clock can be used without any properties and will display a 24-hour clock in HH:MM:SS UTC format along with the day of the year.

```

###Advanced HTML Usage
The following example shows a more advanced RUX Clock instance with data-bound __aos__ and __los__ values as well as hiding the timezone and day of year display. 

```xml
<rux-clock
	aos=[[sat1.aos]]
	los=[[sat1.los]]
	hide-timezon=true
	hide-date=true></rux-clock>
```
